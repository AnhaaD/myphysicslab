<!--
* Runs a single unit test, for uncompiled debugging only.
* The test is specified via a <script> tag, which
* causes that unit test script to be loaded, so that its various functions
* are defined in the global scope.  The unit test functions have names starting
* with the word 'test' which allows them to be found by goog.testing.junit.
*
* The unit test is activated if one of the unit tests includes the line
*   goog.require('goog.testing.jsunit');
* which causes a function in jsunit to auto-execute (after all the scripts
* on the page have loaded).  That function looks for functions in the global scope
* whose name begins with 'test', and it then runs all those tests in alphabetic
* order, reporting the results by inserting elements into the webpage.
* You can also see the results in the console.
